;;; po-mode+.el --- Extensions to GNU gettext's `po-mode.el'.
;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package is an extension to `po-mode.el', GNU Gettext's major
;; mode for editing PO files. It is made for po-mode version 2.01, and
;; is not likely to work with later versions (yet).
;;
;; Although written, tested and used in Emacs 22.x, po-mode+ might
;; work in other versions too.
;;
;; You may adjust some variables, below, by defining them in your
;; `.emacs' file, either directly or through command 'M-x customize'.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;;  Put this file where Emacs can find it, and place the following in
;;  your `~/.emacs':
;;
;;  (autoload 'po-mode "po-mode+"
;;   "Major mode for translators to edit PO files" t)
;;
;;  Make sure `po-mode.el' is available for Emacs, but don't load it
;;  explicitly.
