- Linewrapping in the subedit. Can we use longlines.el or get hints from it?

- Improve the auxiliary feature. I want another window/frame that
  displays the auxiliary translation in real-time, much like KBabel's
  search view. This should perhaps be a generic view that allows for
  other kinds of searches as well. Easy copying to the msgstr is a
  must.

- Search and replace in the entire file.

- Ignore certain characters when searching. (accelerators & ~)

- Syntax highlighting in the strings. Tags, arguments, etc. I'd like
  to have it both in the main buffer and in the subedit. For example,
  the final "<" character should be toned down.
