- Linewrapping in the subedit. Can we use longlines.el or get hints from it?

- Improve the auxiliary feature. I want another window/frame that
  displays the auxiliary translation in real-time, much like KBabel's
  search view. This should perhaps be a generic view that allows for
  other kinds of searches as well. Easy copying to the msgstr is a
  must.

  - Remember to make something for terminal users, too.

  - It would be nice to be able to edit the matching string in the
    auxiliary file.

- Search and replace in the entire file.

- Ignore certain characters when searching. (accelerators & ~)

- Syntax highlighting in the strings. Tags, arguments, etc. I'd like
  to have it both in the main buffer and in the subedit. For example,
  the final "<" character should be toned down.

- Nicer look. Uneditable parts can be toned down, and a proportional
  font can be used. (Compared KBabel, po-mode seems to waste a lot of
  screen space.) This should be an option.
